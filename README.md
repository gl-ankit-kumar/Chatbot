## Description:

This project explores the development of an interactive chatbot trained on the content of Aur√©lien G√©ron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition." Step-by-step walkthrough of the training process is provided, allowing you to recreate the chatbot or use the provided code as a foundation for your own projects.

## Key Features:

- Interactive: Engage in conversations with the chatbot, asking questions about machine learning concepts covered in the book or exploring broader topics.
- OpenAI Integration: If the chatbot doesn't find an answer within its knowledge base, it seamlessly connects with OpenAI for more comprehensive and interactive responses.
- Step-by-step Training Guide: Detailed explanation of the training process, including data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation.
- Code Provided: Access to the complete Python code used to train the chatbot and integrate with OpenAI, facilitating your understanding and customization.
- Open-source: Feel free to fork and adapt the code for your own purposes.

## How this Chatbot Works:

### 1. Conversation Initiation:
The chatbot begins by warmly greeting the user and asking for their name(Node 1).
Once the user enters their name, the chatbot introduces itself as their personal assistant and invites them to ask questions (Node 2).

### 2. Answering Questions:
The chatbot first attempts to locate the answer within its trained knowledge base of machine learning concepts (Node 3).
If the answer is found, it provides the information to the user.
If the answer is not found, it seamlessly connects with OpenAI to generate a more comprehensive and interactive response(Node 6).

### 3. Satisfaction Check:
After providing an answer, the chatbot prompts the user to confirm if they are satisfied with the response (Node 4).
If the user is satisfied, the conversation concludes gracefully.
If the user is not satisfied, the chatbot invites them to rephrase their question or provide more context (Node 5).

### 4. Iteration and Refinement:
The chatbot encourages further interaction, continuously learning and adapting to user feedback.

### 7. Conclusion
This data science project provides a holistic analysis of the Titanic dataset, spanning data exploration, feature engineering, machine learning model training, and evaluation. Explore visualizations, discover trends, and evaluate model accuracy for predictive insights.
